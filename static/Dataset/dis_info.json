Conjunctivitis can be extremely contagious, and is spread by contact with eye secretions from someone who is infected.Symptoms include redness, itching, and tearing of the eyes. It can also lead to discharge or crusting around the eyes.It's important to stop wearing contact lenses while affected by conjunctivitis. It often resolves on its own, but treatment can speed the recovery process. Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with antihistamines. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be treated with antibiotic eye drops.",
